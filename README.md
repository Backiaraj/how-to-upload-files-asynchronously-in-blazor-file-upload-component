# how-to-upload-files-asynchronously-in-blazor-file-upload-component
A quick-start project that helps you to upload files asynchronously in the Blazor file upload component using the Blazor server application. This project contains the code to enable the chunk upload by splitting large files into small chunks and transferring them to the server using Ajax. You will also find the code to upload all the files in the folder by enabling directory uploading and dropping files in the custom drop area for uploading.
